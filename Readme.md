Implementation of the challenges described in the link above using _F#_.

### Setup

* Install the _Prerequisites_ from the [getting started][gs] page.
* Install Maelstrom:
    * Windows: You can use the specified tarball of the installation (as specified in the [getting started][gs] page)
      and extract it into the repository root (so that the jar will be inside `maelstrom\lib\`). You can now use
      the `maelstorm.ps1` script to run it.
    * Other OSes: just follow the installation as described.
